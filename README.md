## Hi there 👋 I'm Raymundo

Asoon-to-be graduate in Applied Mathematics and Computing from Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. I'm deeply passionate about blending mathematics with computing to solve real-world problems. My journey has taken me through the realms of quality assurance, iOS development, and even teaching mechatronics.

### A Bit More About Me:

🖥️ I'm a big fan of Python and Swift. I've also dabbled in CoreML, Vision, Figma, and a bunch of other cool tools like MySQL and AWS. I’m always on GitHub, tinkering with code or collaborating on projects.

💡 I've got a knack for UX/UI Design and Project Management. I'm all about creative problem-solving, be it through design thinking or challenge-based learning.

🗣️ Communication is key! I work myself everyday on my oratory skills, teamwork capabilities, and leadership qualities. I'm all about taking initiative and sweating the small stuff (in a good way!).

🍏 I’m an Apple Developer Academy student, and that experience really honed my skills in iOS development.

### Some Cool Stuff I've Done:

NutriScan: An iOS app using CoreML, VisionKit, and a custom-built API, providing users with nutritional information of scanned food and a personal food consumption tracker. Digame: A prototype app aimed to serve as a sign language interpreter, currently featuring a SwiftUI-based UI, with future plans for AI integration allowing uswrs to scan ingredients and displaying full recipes to make.

CowShip abduction: An IOS arcadegame game using spritekit. 

Hivecents: An IOS app that functions as a personal goal tracker to achieve your financial goals. 

### Learning Never Stops:

Education: I'm polishing off my degree in Applied Mathematics and Computing at UNAM.

Academy: I'm currently studying at an Apple Developer Academy in Naples, Italy.

Certifications Galore: I've got a bunch of certifications under my belt - from IBM Academy, Apple Teacher, Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, to Cisco Networking Academy in cybersecurity.

### Fun Fact:

🏆 I've won awards in Bizcamp, Coding Rush ITAM, Brain Quest ITAM, and a few hackathons. I love a good challenge!
